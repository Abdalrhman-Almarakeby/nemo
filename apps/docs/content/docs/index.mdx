import {Tab, Tabs} from 'next-docs-ui/components/tabs';

## Motivation

I'm working with Next.js project for a few years now, after Vercel moved multiple `/**/_middleware.ts` files to a single `/middleware.ts` file, there was a unfilled gap - but just for now. After a 2023 retro I had found that there is no good solution for that problem, so I took matters into my own hands. I wanted to share that motivation with everyone here, as I think that we all need to remember how it all started.

Hope it will save you some time and would make your project DX better!

## Installation

Paste installation command into your terminal to install package.

<Tabs items={['Bun', 'PNPM', 'NPM', 'Yarn']}>
  <Tab value="Bun">
    ```bash
    bun add next-easy-middlewares
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="PNPM">
    ```bash
    pnpm add next-easy-middlewares
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="NPM">
    ```bash
    npm install next-easy-middlewares
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add next-easy-middlewares
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Basic middleware usage

```typescript title="/middleware.ts" {5,9}
import { createMiddleware } from 'next-easy-middlewares';
import { type NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

const middlewares = {
  // define your middlewares here...
};

// Create middlewares helper
export const middleware = createMiddleware(middlewares);

export const config = {
  /*
   * Match all paths except for:
   * 1. /api/ routes
   * 2. /_next/ (Next.js internals)
   * 3. /_static (inside /public)
   * 4. /_vercel (Vercel internals)
   * 5. Static files (e.g. /favicon.ico, /sitemap.xml, /robots.txt, etc.)
   */
  matcher: ['/((?!api/|_next/|_static|_vercel|[\\w-]+\\.\\w+).*)'],
};
```
