## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Paste installation command into your terminal to install package.

    <Tabs items={['Bun', 'PNPM', 'NPM', 'Yarn']}>
      <Tab value="Bun">
        ```bash title="Terminal"
        bun add next-easy-middlewares
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="PNPM">
        ```bash title="Terminal"
        pnpm add next-easy-middlewares
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="NPM">
        ```bash title="Terminal"
        npm install next-easy-middlewares
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="Yarn">
        ```bash title="Terminal"
        yarn add next-easy-middlewares
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Import the package inside middleware.ts file.

    (or create it if you don't have one yet)

    ```typescript title="middleware.ts"
    import { createMiddleware } from 'next-easy-middlewares';  // [!code ++]

    // [...]
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Use the createMiddleware function to create a middleware helper.

    ```typescript title="middleware.ts"
    import { createMiddleware } from 'next-easy-middlewares';

    export const middleware = createMiddleware(/* your functions will go here */); // [!code ++]

    // [...]
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Define your middlewares config and update the createMiddleware function parameters.

    ```typescript title="middleware.ts"
    import { createMiddleware } from 'next-easy-middlewares'; // [!code --]
    import { createMiddleware, type MiddlewareFunctionProps } from 'next-easy-middlewares'; // [!code ++]

    const middlewares = { // [!code ++]
      '/': [ // [!code ++]
        async ({request, response}: MiddlewareFunctionProps) => { // [!code ++]
          console.log('Hello from next-easy-middlewares', request.nextUrl.pathname); // [!code ++]
          return response; // [!code ++]
        }, // [!code ++]
      ], // [!code ++]
    }; // [!code ++]

    export const middleware = createMiddleware(/* your functions will go here */); // [!code --]
    export const middleware = createMiddleware(middlewares); // [!code ++]

    // [...]
    ```

    After that step, you should see an `Hello from next-easy-middlewares` message in your console for every request made to your application.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Optimize your middleware execution to not execute it on every signle request.

    ```typescript title="middleware.ts"
    // [...]

    export const config = { // [!code ++]
      matcher: ['/((?!_next/|_static|_vercel|[\\w-]+\\.\\w+).*)'], // [!code ++]
    }; // [!code ++]
    ```

    That will prevent your middleware from executing on routes:
    1. `/_next/` (Next.js internals)
    2. `/_static` (inside /public)
    3. `/_vercel` (Vercel internals)
    4. Static files (e.g. `/favicon.ico`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Finally, let's put it all together.

    ```typescript title="middleware.ts"
    import { createMiddleware, type MiddlewareFunctionProps } from 'next-easy-middlewares';

    const middlewares = {
      '/': [
        async ({request, response}: MiddlewareFunctionProps) => {
          console.log('Hello from next-easy-middlewares', request.nextUrl.pathname);
          return response;
        },
      ],
    };

    export const middleware = createMiddleware(middlewares);

    export const config = {
      matcher: ['/((?!_next/|_static|_vercel|[\\w-]+\\.\\w+).*)'],
    };
    ```

    That's how should your `middleware.ts` file looks like after all steps.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Motivation

I'm working with Next.js project for a few years now, after Vercel moved multiple `/**/_middleware.ts` files to a single `/middleware.ts` file, there was a unfilled gap - but just for now. After a 2023 retro I had found that there is no good solution for that problem, so I took matters into my own hands. I wanted to share that motivation with everyone here, as I think that we all need to remember how it all started.

Hope it will save you some time and would make your project DX better!
